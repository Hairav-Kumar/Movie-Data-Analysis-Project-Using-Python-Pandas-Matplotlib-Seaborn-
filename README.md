# Movie-Data-Analysis-Project-Using-Python-Pandas-Matplotlib-Seaborn-
In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of a movie dataset, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to uncover meaningful insights and answer key business questions:

Performed EDA to understand data distribution and identify patterns, trends, and outliers across variables like runtime, revenue, and voting scores.
Identified movies with runtime over 180 minutes to spotlight extended-length films.
Discovered the year with the highest average voting score, offering insights into changing viewer preferences.
Found the year with the highest average revenue, revealing peak financial performance.
Listed the Top 10 lengthy movies by title and runtime for a comparative look at movie durations.
Analyzed the number of movies produced per year to track industry growth over time.
Identified the most popular movie title based on highest revenue.
Displayed the Top 10 highest revenue movies, showcasing top-grossing films in the dataset.
This project highlights my expertise in data cleaning, transformation, and visualization, along with my ability to extract actionable insights from exploratory data analysis in the entertainment industry.
